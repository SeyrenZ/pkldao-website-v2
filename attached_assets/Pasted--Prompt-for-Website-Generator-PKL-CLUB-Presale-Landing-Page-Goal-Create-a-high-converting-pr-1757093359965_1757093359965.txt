# Prompt for Website Generator: PKL.CLUB Presale Landing Page

## Goal
Create a **high-converting presale website** for **PKL.CLUB** — the world’s first decentralized Pickleball community and $PKL token.  
The site must **copy the structure, controls, and UI inspiration** from **Best Wallet’s site (https://bestwallet.com/en/)** while replacing all content with PKL-specific content.  

## Theme & Design
- **Light theme**, clean and modern.
- Rounded containers with soft shadows.
- Animated countdown timers, hover effects, and scroll-based reveals.
- **Color palette:**
  - Green `#00a86b` (primary CTA, brand)
  - Yellow `#c4f000` (accent, highlights, progress bars)
  - White `#eee8e8` (background, cards)
  - Orange `#ff533e` (secondary CTA, urgency, alerts)
- Typography: Bold geometric sans (Poppins, Inter). Body text clean sans (Inter/Roboto).
- Icons: Flat, playful, 2.5D style (sporty / crypto inspired).
